# Connectulum
**Connectulum** provides advanced connectivity and session management to **Trisolian** hub infrastructure.

**Trisol** is a proprietary (and fictional) remote infrastructure domain providing server and application
resources on demand. 

## Status
Basic connectivity and cryptographic primitives for the proprietary system are available.

## Next Steps / Contributing
Next steps will be around session management -- connecting a user to the Trisolian 
infrastructure securely and maintaining this connection through multiple requests for
resources.

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/trisolaria/connectulum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) for up-to-date status.
